# DDR Unity Remake

This is a **simple remake of Dance Dance Revolution (DDR)** in Unity, inspired by **StepMania**. It includes an **OSZ file importer** (for Osu! beatmaps) in the editor and is still a **work in progress** as part of a final middle school project. The game is designed to work with **arrow keys** and will support the **DDR controller Python script** for playing with a physical DDR pad.

## 🎮 Features

- **Basic DDR gameplay** with arrow key input.
- **OSZ file importer** to load Osu! beatmaps in the editor.
- **Upcoming support for DDR Pad Controller** via serial communication.
- **Work in progress:** Many improvements and refinements planned!

## 🖥 Controls

- **Arrow Keys** – Move according to the DDR steps.
- **Planned:** DDR pad support using the Python serial script.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Download & Install Unity**
   - Make sure you have **Unity 2021+** installed.

2. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-link>
   ```

3. **Open in Unity**
   - Open the project in Unity Hub and load the scene.

4. **Run the Game**
   - Press Play in the Unity Editor or build the game for your platform.

## 🎯 Future Goals

- Full **DDR Pad Controller** support.
- More **gameplay mechanics** and scoring system.
- Better **visual feedback** for player input.
- **More beatmap formats** beyond OSZ.

## 📌 Notes

- This is an early **work-in-progress** project, expect bugs and incomplete features.
- The OSZ importer only works in the **editor for now**, not in the built game.
